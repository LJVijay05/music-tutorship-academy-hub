# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Summary
Complete performance audit and optimization to improve loading times and Core Web Vitals.

## Issues Identified
- **TTFB**: 892ms (needs improvement - target: <600ms)
- **LCP**: 17420ms, 17704ms (critical - target: <2.5s)
- Redundant performance monitoring code
- Heavy blur animations on hero section
- Non-optimized image loading
- Missing resource hints
- Suboptimal bundle splitting

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. HTML & Resource Loading
- ✅ Added high-priority preloading for critical images
- ✅ Optimized font loading with async stylesheet loading
- ✅ Added proper crossorigin attributes for preconnect
- ✅ Created caching headers file (_headers) for better asset caching

### 2. Image Optimization
- ✅ Added `loading="lazy"` to below-the-fold images
- ✅ Added `decoding="async"` for non-blocking image decode
- ✅ Optimized image positioning (object-fit)
- ✅ Removed duplicate image preloading code

### 3. JavaScript Optimization
- ✅ Removed duplicate performance monitoring setup
- ✅ Deferred Web Vitals loading using requestIdleCallback
- ✅ Optimized AnimatedCounter to defer animation 300ms
- ✅ Removed redundant image preloading in Index.tsx
- ✅ Created DeferredAnimations component for non-critical animations

### 4. Bundle Optimization
- ✅ Improved chunk splitting strategy with dynamic imports
- ✅ Separated vendor chunks by library type (react, ui, router, etc.)
- ✅ Added lucide-react to optimizeDeps for faster dev server
- ✅ Enabled CSS code splitting
- ✅ Disabled compressed size reporting for faster builds
- ✅ Set chunk size warning limit to 1000kb

### 5. CSS & Animation Optimization
- ✅ Reduced blur complexity in Hero (blur-3xl → blur-2xl)
- ✅ Removed unnecessary animate-pulse from background elements
- ✅ Reduced number of animated background elements (3 → 2)
- ✅ Optimized opacity for better performance

### 6. Caching Strategy
- ✅ Created _headers file with aggressive caching for static assets
- ✅ Set immutable cache for JS/CSS/images (1 year)
- ✅ No cache for HTML files (must-revalidate)
- ✅ Separate cache rules for different asset types

## Expected Improvements

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **TTFB**: Should improve to <600ms with caching headers
- **LCP**: Should improve to <2.5s with image optimization and reduced JS execution
- **FCP**: Should improve with deferred non-critical scripts
- **CLS**: Should remain good with proper image dimensions
- **FID**: Should improve with reduced main thread work

### Other Benefits
- Faster initial page load
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Better browser caching
- Improved perceived performance
- Lower bandwidth usage

## Monitoring
The performance monitoring system will continue to track:
- Long tasks (>50ms)
- Largest Contentful Paint
- First Input Delay
- Web Vitals metrics

Check console for any warnings about performance issues.

## Next Steps for Further Optimization
1. Consider using WebP/AVIF format for images
2. Implement service worker for offline support
3. Add resource hints based on user navigation patterns
4. Consider implementing Progressive Web App features
5. Monitor real user metrics in production
